# AKMC and MD simulations of solid solid phase transformations
This repo includes results from two project where I performed adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo and molecular dynamic simulations of solid-solid phase transformations.  The Duncan16 PDF involves both AKMC and MD simulations. The Barmak17 publication involves MD simulations performed by myself and an undergraduate student in my research group. All results generated from EON software along with python and bash scripting.
